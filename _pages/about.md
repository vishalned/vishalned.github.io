I am Vishal Nedungadi, currently a PhD student at [Wageningen University and Research](https://www.wur.nl/en.htm), where I am supervised by [Ioannis N. Athanasiadis](https://www.athanasiadis.info/) and [Marc Ru√üwurm](https://marcrusswurm.com/).  Prior to this I was working in several research labs as follows: 
- Research Associate at [Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/) at Abu Dhabi, supervised by [Dr. Salman Khan](https://salman-h-khan.github.io/) in the domain of weather and climate forecasting.
- Visiting Researcher at the [Pioneer Center For AI](https://www.aicentre.dk/) at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, supervised by [Nico Lang](https://langnico.github.io/) and [Serge Belongie](https://www.belongielab.org/) in representation learning for earth observation data.
- Researcher at KTH, Sweden, supervised by [Yifang Ban](https://www.kth.se/profile/yifang) in Wildfire monitoring.

Before these research visits, I completed my Master's degree (July 2023) in Machine Learning from [KTH](https://www.kth.se/en), Stockholm, Sweden.


My research interests encompass Deep Learning and Computer Vision, with a recent focus on practical Machine Learning applications (environmentally focused), particularly in Remote Sensing and what I like to call eco-conscious AI. My current research has led me to have a specific interest in multi-modal learning and representation learning. I am currently trying to understand more about embeddings and what they can do. 

Feel free to reach out to me for potential research collaborations.
