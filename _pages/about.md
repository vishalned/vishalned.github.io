I am Vishal Nedungadi, currently a Research Associate at [Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/), Abu Dhabi, UAE. I am working with [Dr. Salman Khan](https://salman-h-khan.github.io/) in the domain of climate modelling. Before this I was  a Visiting Researcher at the [Pioneer Center For AI](https://www.aicentre.dk/) at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark. My research interests encompass Deep Learning and Computer Vision, with a recent focus on practical Machine Learning applications, particularly in remote sensing. Incase you are not familiar, an example of remote sensing involves working with satellite images.

At the Pioneer Center, I'm fortunate to work under the guidance of [Nico Lang](https://langnico.github.io/) and [Serge Belongie](https://www.belongielab.org/), delving into remote sensing and representation learning, emphasizing remote sensing datasets.

In the summer of 2023, I worked as a researcher at KTH's Division of Geoinformatics, supervised by [Yifang Ban](https://www.kth.se/profile/yifang) and [Puzhao Zhang](https://www.kth.se/profile/puzhao) on Wildfire Monitoring in Satellite Images.

I recently completed my Master's degree (July 2023) in Machine Learning from [KTH](https://www.kth.se/en), Stockholm, Sweden, where my master's thesis explored "Street to Aerial View Geolocalization."
