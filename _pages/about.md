I am Vishal Nedungadi, currently a Visiting Researcher at the [Pioneer Center For AI](https://www.aicentre.dk/) at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark. My research interests encompass Deep Learning and Computer Vision, with a recent focus on practical Machine Learning applications, particularly in remote sensing. Incase you are not familiar, an example of remote sensing involves working with satellite images from satellites such as [Sentinel 2](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2c).

At the Pioneer Center, I'm fortunate to work under the guidance of [Nico Lang](https://langnico.github.io/) and [Serge Belongie](https://www.belongielab.org/), delving into remote sensing and representation learning, emphasizing remote sensing datasets.

In the summer of 2023, I worked as a researcher at KTH's Division of Geoinformatics, supervised by [Yifang Ban](https://www.kth.se/profile/yifang) and [Puzhao Zhang](https://www.kth.se/profile/puzhao) on Wildfire Monitoring in Satellite Images.

I recently completed my Master's degree (July 2023) in Machine Learning from [KTH](https://www.kth.se/en), Stockholm, Sweden, where my master's thesis explored "Street to Aerial View Geolocalization."
